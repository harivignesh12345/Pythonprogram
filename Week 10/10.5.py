Given an listof integers, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the following three lines:

1.      List is sorted in numSwaps swaps., where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.

2.      First Element: firstElement, the  first element in the sorted list.

3.      Last Element: lastElement, the last element in the sorted list.

For example, given a worst-case but small array to sort: a=[6,4,1]. It took  3 swaps to sort the array. Output would be

Array is sorted in 3 swaps.  
First Element: 1  
Last Element: 6   
Input Format

The first line contains an integer,n , the size of the list a .
The second line contains  n,  space-separated integers a[i].

Constraints

·         2<=n<=600

·         1<=a[i]<=2x106.

Output Format

You must print the following three lines of output:

1.      List is sorted in numSwaps swaps., where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.

2.      First Element: firstElement, the  first element in the sorted list.

3.      Last Element: lastElement, the last element in the sorted list.

Sample Input 0

3

1 2 3

Sample Output 0

List is sorted in 0 swaps.

First Element: 1

Last Element: 3



For example:

Input	Result
3
3 2 1
List is sorted in 3 swaps.
First Element: 1
Last Element: 3
5
1 9 2 8 4
List is sorted in 4 swaps.
First Element: 1
Last Element: 9
